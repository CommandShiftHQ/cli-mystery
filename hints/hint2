Try poking around the contents of a file by using the 'head' command:

  head -n 20 people

This will show you the first 20 lines of the 'people' file.

Take note of the column headings. 

Using the grep command search for the witnesses name in the 'people' file, and then use the pipe operator to search that list by gender.

When searching the file, remember that grep uses regular expressions to match the text.

Regular expressions (Regex or RegExp) allow you to describe a complex pattern to search for in some text - you can use this to your advantage here.

For example, in RegExp, the ^ character means "the beginning of a line"
To search for the word "Annabel" at the start of a line, you can use the regular expression "^Annabel".

\s is a space in RegExp. To search for the letter F surrounded by spaces, you can try "\sF\s"

Combining these two should help you find the people you're looking for.

Regular Expressions can be a tricky thing to get your head around, but are a powerful tool and are definitely worth being comfortable with, even if you're not an expert.
