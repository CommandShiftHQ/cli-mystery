Now you need to search for multiple keywords in one file. How can you combine `grep` with flags and the pipe operator ('|') to filter the vehicle records for:

* car model
* car color
* license plate number
* suspect's height

To find a matching license plate, or a matching car, you can use grep on the 'vehicles' file:

	grep "Honda" mystery/vehicles

	grep "Blue" mystery/vehicles

	grep "L337" mystery/vehicles

This doesn't give us anything useful - why not? Try using 'head' on the file to investigate its structure.

You can use the -A and -B flags with grep to get the matching lines plus the lines after (-A) or before (-B)

  grep "Honda" -B 1 mystery/vehicles

This will give you all lines matching "Honda", plus the lines before the matches too.
