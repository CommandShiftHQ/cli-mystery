There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

Before you start, make sure you have read the command-line byte and you're familiar with Git commands. You might want to use them as a reference while solving the mystery.

Don't use a text editor. The objective of this exercise it to get more comfortable using the command line, and you will find that it is an incredibly powerful tool on its own.

You can use Google, course materials, cheatsheets or any other materials available.

## Step 1: Getting set up

Once you're ready, you'll need to fork this repository to your own account and clone it down. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) (follow both section headings _Fork an example repository_ and _Keep your fork synced_).

## Step 2: Investigate!

There are three directories in this repo - `mystery`, `steps` and `hints`

- `mystery` contains all of the information you will need to go through to solve the mystery
- `steps` contains some instructions to guide you on your way
- `hints` contains some hints for some of the steps - don't use these until you've attempted to solve the step yourself, and be aware that not every step has a hint.

To get started, open a Terminal, go to the location of the files, and start by reading the file `steps/step0`.

Good luck!
