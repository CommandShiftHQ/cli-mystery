Now you have more information to identify the perpetrator. Peek into the './mystery/vehicles' file. What information does it contain? Cross-reference it with your 'clues.txt' again - is there anything else you could search for in the vehicles record?

Save the list of suspects into a new file called 'suspects.txt'.

Move on to step 6.

If you get stuck, take a look at hint5.
