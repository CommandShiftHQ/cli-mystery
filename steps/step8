Congratulations! You caught the murderer!

To close the investigation and let the courts do their work, save his name in a file called 'jail.txt'.

Change permissions on the file so that you are the only one able to edit it (everyone else can read the contents). There was a case last summer where a convict was switched out for an innocent man on the way to jail - and we don't want that happening again! 

Now the Chief needs to review your work! Head to Slack and send one of your instructors a direct message. Don't post in the main channel, as this information is TOP SECRET until we're ready to release it to the press! 

You can now relax and wait for that promotion, Detective!
