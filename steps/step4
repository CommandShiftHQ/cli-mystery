You should now have 2 matches for women named 'Annabel'. You also their addresses.

There is a 'streets' subdirectory in the 'mystery' directory with a list of files named after streets.

See if you can find files matching street names for the two Annabels.

Take a look inside the files you've found. 

Among the information available in 'possible_witnesses.txt', you have references to line numbers. See if you can use the line numbers to discover something useful about the witnesses.

Write the relevant line in each of the two address files to a file called 'interviews.txt'. Commit it and push to GitHub.

If you get stuck check out hint4.
