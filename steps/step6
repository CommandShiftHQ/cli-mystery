There is one final outstanding clue from your original clues.txt files that hasn't been used: the list of memberships in the wallet found at the crime scene. 

If you can figure out which of your 4 suspects holds all of the membership cards found in the wallet, there's a good chance you'll have your culprit.

What files does the './mystery/memberships' subdirectory contain? What's inside these files?

Remember that the `cat` command was originally intended for concatenating files. Using this how can you tell if one suspect has all of the memberships?

How many membership cards were in the wallet? Can you automatically count if the suspect has all of them using `grep`, `wc` commands and the pipe operator?

If you managed to narrow your investigation down to one suspect, read the `solution` file to verify that you have found the killer and move on to 'step7'

If not, retrace your steps until there is only one suspect.
