Now you've taken a look around the mystery files, it's time to start collecting clues.

Using the "less" command, have a read of the "crimescene" file.

It's a pretty long file - The officers on the scene are meticulous, and have written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports.

Fortunately the sergeant went through and marked the real clues with the word "CLUE" in all caps.

Your first challenge is to search for lines in the file marked with the word 'CLUE'.

Once you've found all the clues it's time to save them to a file for future reference. Can you remember how to redirect some text output into a new file?

Once you've got the clues saved into a "clues.txt" file, move onto "step2"
